## How to start? - Run next commands.
To start using the app, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

Once you have those dependencies installed, you can clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then, you can run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt to get the app up and running:

### `npm install`
This command will install all the necessary node-modules that the app needs to run.

### `npm start`
This command will start the app in development mode and open it in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
This command will build the app for production and output the files to the build folder. It will correctly bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.
